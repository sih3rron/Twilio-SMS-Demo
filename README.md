# Twilio-SMS-Demo

### What is this? ###

This is a short demo to illustrate how Launchdarkly feature flagging and experimentation can be used on a media subject such as SMS. I have cannibalised one of their tutorial apps in order to build this out.

### What do I need to run it? ###

You would need a Twilio Trial Account as they will provide a telephone number and destination for your SMS.
